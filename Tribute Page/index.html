				About Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj
			</h1>
			<p id="tribute-info">Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, born on February 19, 1630, in the hill-fort of Shivneri,
				was a prominent Maratha warrior and the founder of the Maratha Empire in western India.
				His life and legacy have left an indelible mark on Indian history,
				embodying the spirit of resistance against the Mughal Empire and the quest for self-governance.<br> </br>

				Shivaji was born to Shahaji Bhonsle, a Maratha general, and Jijabai,
				whose teachings profoundly influenced his early life. Jijabai instilled in him a sense of pride and
				responsibility towards their land and people. From a young age, Shivaji exhibited exceptional leadership qualities
				and a strong sense of justice.<br> </br>

				By the age of 16, Shivaji had gathered a band of loyal followers and began his campaign to establish a Maratha kingdom.
				He captured his first fort, Torna, in 1645, marking the beginning of his journey as a leader.
				Over the next few years, he strategically acquired numerous forts and territories,
				employing guerrilla warfare tactics that became his trademark.<br> </br>

				One of the most significant milestones in Shivaji's life was his coronation as Chhatrapati on June 6, 1674,
				at Raigad Fort. This event was a declaration of sovereignty and the formal establishment of the Maratha Empire.
				The coronation ceremony, conducted with great splendor, included rituals and rites that asserted his legitimacy as an
				independent ruler. It was a symbolic moment, representing the Marathas' aspiration for autonomy from Mughal domination.
				<br> </br>

				Shivaji's administration was marked by progressive policies and efficient governance.
				He established a robust naval force, recognizing the importance of naval supremacy in safeguarding the coastlines.
				His administrative reforms included the creation of a disciplined military structure,
				the introduction of revenue reforms, and the promotion of trade. He also emphasized religious tolerance and
				supported a diverse society, ensuring justice for all his subjects.<br> </br>				

			<p id="tribute-info">Shivaji Maharaj's life story is a testament to his vision, bravery, and leadership.
				His birth on February 19, 1630, and his coronation on June 6, 1674, are two pivotal dates that mark the beginning and
				the peak of his illustrious journey. He remains a revered figure in Indian history,
				celebrated for his contributions to the Maratha identity and the broader Indian resistance against colonial and
				imperial forces. <br> </br>

				Shivaji was well known for his strong religious and warrior code of ethics and exemplary character.
				He was recognized as a great national hero during Indian Independence Movement.
				Shivaji is also known for his respect for women. In his empire, the violence on women was a serious
				crime.
				There are also accounts where he punished the people who were accused of crime on women.
				While some accounts of Shivaji state that he was greatly influenced by the Brahmin guru Samarth Ramdas,
				others have rebutted that Ramdas' role has been over-emphasised by later Brahmin commentators to enhance
				their position.</p><br>
